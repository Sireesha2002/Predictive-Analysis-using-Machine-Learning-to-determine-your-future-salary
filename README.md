# Predictive-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-to-determine-your-future-salary
# Overview
This project aims to estimate an individual's future salary based on various factors using a predictive model. By leveraging Decision Tree Regression, this model allows users to input key details such as their country, specialization, major, and years of experience to predict their expected salary.

The model has been deployed using Streamlit, enabling an easy-to-use interface where users can enter their data and instantly receive salary predictions.

# Features
* Predictive Model: Uses decision tree regression to estimate salary based on user inputs.
* User-friendly Interface: Deployed via Streamlit to allow users to easily input details and view results in real-time.
* Key Inputs:
   * Country
   * Specialization
   * Major
   * Experience
# Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
* NumPy for numerical operations.
* Matplotlib for data visualization.
* Machine Learning: Implementing Decision Tree Regression to build the predictive model.
# Setup Instructions
1) Clone the repository:

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predictive-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-to-determine-your-future-salary.git
  
2) Navigate into the project directory:
   
  cd Predictive-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-to-determine-your-future-salary
  
3) Install the required libraries:

  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit
  
4) Run the Streamlit app:

  streamlit run app.py
  
# Usage
Once the app is running, enter your:
* Country
* Specialization
* Major
* Years of Experience

The model will predict your estimated salary based on these inputs.
